Hi, I’m Xhen. I’m a senior med student in Saudi Arabia and have taken upon myself the challenge to learn programming.
I intend to learn lots of different stuff in order to achieve my ambitions, God willing. The reason I chose to embark upon this journey is that I felt stuck—standing and watching
as many people soar through their knowledge of programming and AI. I believe we are amidst a new technological revolution as big as the internet, if not bigger.
Thus, I want to seize the opportunity with my own hands, achieving great things that make my country better.
I hope to be one of the causes behind Saudi Arabia’s GDP growing to over \$20 trillion in the next 40 years by building companies that rival Alphabet, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta.
