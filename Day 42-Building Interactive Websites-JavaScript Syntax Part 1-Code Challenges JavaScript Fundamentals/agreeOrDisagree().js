// Write your function here:
const agreeOrDisagree = (user1Statment, user2Statment) => {
  if (user1Statment === user2Statment) {
    return 'You agree!'
  } else {
    return 'You disagree!'
  }
};





// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
 console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "yep"))
 console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "nope"))
// Should print 'You agree!'

// We encourage you to add more function call of your own to test your code!
